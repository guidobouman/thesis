### Activity per competency
#### Research & Innovation
##### Goals
As researching is not one of our strong suits, we'll have to look into possible research methods and how to apply them. For instance, this will be our first time conducting interviews on key people in our relevant industries. He'll have to learn how to conduct them properly so we can rely on the information obtained during those interviews.

##### Possible hazards
Getting the right information from interviews can be tricky. To make sure we get as much relevant information as possible, we'll have to extensively plan our interviews. Preparing each question in advance, and recording the whole conversation will help us getting the most valuable knowledge from our interviewees.

##### Tasks
Before getting started on the thesis we need to find the unambiguous questions behind our problem and setup related goals. This is required so we can focus our attention while researching on the core problem.

We need to gather information about existing web platforms, structures, databases and thus need to do research. We’ll be collecting this information through interviews and desk research. Prior to doing the research we’ll have to write a research plan. To be able to conduct our interviews properly we'll be reading some books about this subject. This knowledge will be included in the Research plan together with all the choices we make prior to doing the research.

##### Guido
While I find a lot of information on the internet, documenting these vast amounts of information is not my strong suit. Currently I'm using my browser bookmarks to save all interesting information, but this is far from ideal. I would like to try a service called bo.lt which deals with a lot of the issues that can occur when bookmarking interesting items. It makes your data persistent, locally saving a backup of each item you bookmark. It also lets you add descriptions and categorise the stored items.

##### Jelle
My first big official research! I hope to learn how to do proper research on a higher level and make a paper which is publishable. I predict I will lose track of the large quantities of information. So some proper information management is needed. Using web bookmarking services and my e reader’s bookmarking engine I hope to keep track of the relevant information. Learn how to set up proper documentation. I also need to learn to start writing documentation at the start of the project. If I keep the phase high, challenge high and interestingness up I’m able to keep motivated.

##### Results
* Interviews
* Research plan
* Advice/Vision 
* Goal set
* Thesis plan
* Research document

#### Concepting
##### Goals
The concept and vision we want to make is a very long term one, futuristic and sci-fi like, but concrete. After getting answers on the research questions we’ll be able through brainstorming and testing to form a future vision. We’ll have to find a way on how to communicate the concept and vision.

##### Possible hazards
No inspiration, tunnel vision, too complex ideas, but none of these hazards should be a big deal as long as we get feedback from others.

##### Tasks
Based on our research we are going to create a vision which takes into account the needs of the intended uses.

After distilling our vision from the research we have to make the vision concrete by making a proper concept and a visualisation of the concept. The concept should be easy to understand by others with little knowledge on the subject. 

##### Guido
I would like to create a new habit for myself, using paper more often. I think that especially in our field of work you can look at computer screens too much. By approaching the same subject on paper I think I could come up with new ideas I wouldn't have come up with otherwise.

Drawing techniques I would like to use for my concepting phase include drawing scenario's, brainstorming using persona's and reverse brainstorming.

##### Jelle
Being a veteran ‘Concepting’ student, I’m quite used to brainstorm sessions, but to my opinion my output still lacks. I would like to do more with (visual) metaphors and story telling. I will try to find a way find suiting metaphors and story lines next to (and enhancing) the vision document. 

##### Results
* Vision document
* Vision presentation

#### Multimedia Design
##### Goals
Our goals is to learn how to create a future vision on an academic level. We want to design a structure which will stay relevant for years to come.  For this we need to develop a new kind of mindset. Thinking beyond borders of just implementing a technology, and instead start thinking about creating our own technologies.

##### Possible hazards
It's hard to think about uninvented technologies on an abstract level. It's easy to drift off, just thinking about all of the possibilities. Constantly reviewing our progression & writing down our ideas will help us sort through the vast amount of ideas we will have.

##### Tasks
We’re going to design a structure which should be thoroughly documented so it can easily be implemented by others in the future when technology is ready. Together with the vision document will the design document be the main product of our thesis.

To learn how to write such documents on an academic level, we're going to look at how other professionals have done this. We want to learn from their mistakes & achievements.

##### Guido
Just like with concepting I want to use paper more often, and try to approach my challenges from a different angle. I would like to work out scenario's, diagrams and other assisting illustrations by hand. I think that by using hand drawn illustrations we can add a more human side to our thesis.

##### Jelle
I want to sharpen my skills of making a technical design. In order to make the concept concrete the needs of the product need to be defined. I want to learn more of the technical jargon in order to make the product more suiting to professionals. I’ll be doing this by reading various other technical designs.

##### Results
* The technical design
* Design document
* A suggestion for future development of the internet


#### Multimedia Production
##### Goals
Building a prototype solely on our own ideas.

##### Possible Hazards
We will have to drop features from our prototype even though we designed them ourselves. Always putting the value of the final product above our own desires and reviewing made changes with each other will result in the best possible product.

#####  Tasks
We’ll be creating a prototype out of the vision, concept, structure and technical design.

As we can't currently know what we'll be building, it's hard to plan what we want to learn in advance. Looking into various possible versions of creating a proof of concept could prove useful during this phase of our thesis.

##### Guido
As we'll be working on a prototype, I want to look into different rapid development tools. Meteor is one of those tools I would like to try. It's a new tool which allows for extremely fast development of interactive web applications. I need to set up a work flow which allows me to switch back and forth between the concepting, design development and monitoring phases.

##### Jelle
Because I want to be able to communicate the concept and vision through storytelling in drawing/animation form I have to spice up my Illustrator and drawings skills again. I’ll be doing this by following some tutorials and by just doing it often. 

##### Results
* Creating a prototype/structure
* Creating a proof of concept

#### Quality Monitoring & Implementation
##### Goals
We want to design a future vision which will stay relevant for years. To accomplish this we will have to critically look at our own ideas, and find every single possible flaw.

During this project we'll be applying rapid prototyping. This is not our first try at rapid prototyping, but getting a solid understanding of this technique requires at lot of practice. One of our goals is to master this technique, so we can teach it to others.

##### Possible hazards
Efficiently switching between different phases of rapid prototyping can be really hard. For example we could start over iterating on trivial features and delay the project. Prioritising, sticking to our planning, and really switching phases when required will help us overcome this hazard.

##### Tasks
 Because we’re going to use the rapid prototyping method the vision and concept will be thoroughly tested on it’s fitness and improved where needed. To be able to efficiently use the rapid prototyping method, we'll have to look into our possible hazards, and on how to dodge them. We will do this by looking online at how seasoned rapid prototype experts have tackled these issues.

Because we’re going to be rapid prototyping, we’re constantly testing out our product, the vision. This way research will continue while developing and thus constantly improve our product.  This will result in an even better vision & proof of concept after testing.

As we want to improve our testing abilities, we'll look into different methods of testing our vision, concept & prototype. Especially, learning how to test a vision will be an interesting parts of our learning progress. Right now we can't tell what we'll be testing on, as we don't know what our final product will be. This will become clear after our researching and first concepting phase.

##### Guido
I want to apply the rapid prototyping phase to make sure our final product will be at it's best. To make sure this will be the case I want to introduce an extra step during each iteration of the rapid prototyping phase. At the end of each iteration I want to apply a set of tests to our prototype. Based on our research a list of requirements will made which the prototype has to comply to. Of this is not the case I'll find out how the prototype can be changed to conform to these requirements, and make a change in the design.

##### Jelle
Testing isn’t my strong suit, but I’ve lately learned it’s essential to make something more solid. The way depends on what the product will be, but I’m interested in learning Behaviour Driven Development.

##### Results
* A logbook full of choices, problems we’ve stumbled upon and their solutions.
* A self developed test suite
* A lot of git commits

#### Communication
##### Goals
Learning how to write academic english will be of great value to writing our future vision. Explaining very abstract subjects to other non-technical people requires a specific way of writing. We would be satisfied with our progression if even non-technical people (our parents for example), can understand our concept.

##### Possible hazards
Because we're writing this thesis in English, it will be more time consuming for us. Which can lead to miscalculations in our planning. It's important that we take this into account in our planning.

##### Tasks
We’ll be writing all documents in English because we want reach a big audience and open source during our process. This way it will be easy for anyone to follow our progression and findings through Github.

During the writing we'll constantly let native academic English writers check our documents. Through constant feedback we will learn from our previous mistakes, and prevent them in the future.

##### Guido
I've written quite a lot of english reports already, but none as long as a thesis. For my semester in Sweden I had to pass the official TOEFL test which according to their website "measures your ability to use and understand English at the university level". After my semester in Sweden, I followed the international Art & Sound minor, especially further sharpening my English writing skills.

As our thesis could be of interest for international companies and professionals like scientists, I want our thesis to be available to an audience as broad as possible. My goal is to write a thesis that's easy and pleasant to read for native English speakers.

##### Jelle
Although my english is quite okay, I haven’t written any big english texts yet. I hope by writing (and let it being checked) a lot, my english writing skills will improve in terms of speed and vocabulary.

##### Results
* Full thesis in flawless english
* A presentation
* A suggestion for future development of the internet
* All open sourced for the world to see (and use or fork) on Github.

#### Growth & Reflection
##### Goals
Improve ourselves on a personal level & project wise.

##### Possible hazards
Slacking on reflecting regularly will slow down our growth.

##### Tasks
Prior to starting our thesis we’ve written down our individual expectations and goals. This way we can constantly secure our focus on the progress and make the most out of ourselves as possible. By setting ambitious and bold goals we keep ourselves motivated and will bring a step closer to world domination.

During the thesis we’ll be reflecting on our progression and results. We’ll bundle this afterwards and write a concluding reflection on the whole project.

##### Guido
Before starting our thesis I wrote up my expectations for the thesis. Especially when working in a team it's good to have a clear vision on what you expect and what you want to work on. 

Throughout the thesis I want to apply my own reflection method. I found a technique online called Naikan, which with the use of 3 standard questions focuses on self reflection while looking at your relations with other people. I would like to bend this method to self reflection while looking at professional development and apply it during the thesis.

To help increase my productivity I'm using "Concentrate" which is a OS X desktop app that allows you to apply the pomodoro technique. For a short amount of time (30 minutes usually) the app can close applications, block websites or perform nearly any other task to boost your productivity. When done you're allowed a five minute break before starting a new session. By applying this throughout the day I want to increase my productivity and minimise procrastination.

Because we're working as a duo, we have the unique chance to do peer reflections throughout and after the project. I think this will help us get new insights we wouldn't have noticed by ourselves.

##### Jelle
The problem with justifying my growth process is I’m not good in maintaining the documentation. I need to work on this by starting straightaway. I’m thinking of doing multiple phases of reflection. First write down my expectations and goals of the project. Then write a part about turning points and troubles of the project and conclude with a conclusion if I made my goals, met any troubles and would be do’s and don’t for the next time.

##### Results
* Thesis plan
* A conclusion in the thesis
* Reflection
* In dept self reflection based on different reflection techniques
* Peer reflection of each other
* And git log
