## Planning thesis

### Summary
The problem with our thesis is that the whole concept of removing links in the chain of communication is quite vague. We don't know what we'll be building as we want to initiate a technological advancement. Therefore we can't exactly plan our tasks for every step of our thesis in advance. We will have to work with the results from each previous phase to come up with a planning for the next ones.

Our thesis will roughly consist of 4 phases. When finishing one phase we can create a more accurate planning for the still remaining ones. Of course we can plan the global steps we should take during our thesis, but the specific actions per step will be defined later on.

Our plan is to put a deadline on the research phase (phase 1), and create a revision of our thesis planning when the deadline passes. From there on we can decide what we should do afterwards. So, what we want to build or rapid prototype will be a result of our research phase.

Our deadline for the research phase is rather hard to set because of our move to Moscow. We've done quite a bit of pre-research already and think we have a solid understanding of the subject. To finish our research we expect to only need a couple of weeks to combine and write up our findings. Because we expect to be busy with Moscow until January 5th, we set our deadline for the research phase at January 31st. We will make an iteration over this document once that deadlines passes, and evaluate this revision with our teacher & mentor.
