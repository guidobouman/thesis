## Planning thesis

### Summary
Our thesis will roughly consist of 4 phases. During the first phase we will collect as much valuable information as possible. During this phase we will be focusing on gathering information on the possibilities, previous results in this field, and what is still lacking. As a part of this phase we will conduct interviews with experts in the fields of Neural Communication, Data Storage and Existing Data Protocols. We are hoping these interviews will help us in creating a strong view of the possibilities as they are right now, and the changes or developments required to realise a better internet.

During the next phase we will start looking at the possible solutions to problems found during the first research phase, and the first version of our vision will be developed. Looking for possible solutions and designing a vision will require us to apply rapid prototyping where we will quickly test our proposed solutions and try the validity of our vision with simulated tests. We don't expect our first vision to be a solid and future proof one. That's why we hope applying rapid prototyping will help us reach our goal of making a vision that will be used as one of the leading documents on the future of the internet, even in 5 to 10 years time.

To support our future vision, we would really like to design a proof of concept which will show people the possibilities of an enhanced internet. This is what we'll focus on during the third phase. Because our future vision will most probably take into account technologies currently unavailable, we can't hope to build a perfect working prototype of the evolved internet. But at the very least we want to prove the usability of the vision that we will have designed in 4 months time. The proof we want to provide is based on two designs. First, a protocol that's ready to communicate with the human brain when the electronics are too. And second, a database system that's able to keep up with the human brain when looking at relational links.

For the last phase, we will be finalising our thesis. The thesis summary will be part of our focus. Also will we use this phase to reflect on ourselves and the project. Thinking about what we have learned, and how can we use this knowledge in the upcoming years. This will be our one chance to gain a head start on everyone else in the business.

### Vagueness
One of the problems with this thesis is that we don't know what we will be building. The whole concept of removing links in the chain of communication is quite vague. Our plan is to put a deadline on the research phase, and create a revision of our thesis planning once we're done with our research. From there on we can decide what we should do afterwards. So, currently we cant exactly plan what we want to build or rapid prototype, but that will be a result of our research phase.
