### Research & innovation
While I find a lot of information on the internet, documenting these vast amounts of information is not my strong suit. Currently I'm using my browser bookmarks to save all interesting information, but this is far from ideal. I would like to try a service called bo.lt which deals with a lot of the issues that can occur when bookmarking interesting items. It makes your data persistent, locally saving a backup of each item you bookmark. It also lets you add descriptions and categorise the stored items.

### Concepting
For concepting I want to master the rapid prototyping method. I feel that I'm at my best working with trail-and-error methods. Quickly building something, testing if it works as expected and iterating small improvements along the way. For me it feels like the most productive way of build something. I prefer iterating over a design based on a prototype, not just a design document.

I would like to create a new habit for myself, using paper more often. I think that especially in our field of work you can look at computer screens too much. By approaching the same subject on paper I think I could come up with new ideas I wouldn't have come up with otherwise.

### Growth & Reflection
Before starting our thesis I wrote up my expectations for the thesis. Especially when working in a team it's good to have a clear vision on what you expect and what you want to work on. 

Throughout the thesis I want to apply my own reflection method. I found a technique online called Naikan, which with the use of 3 standard questions focuses on self reflection while looking at your relations with other people. I would like to bend this method to self reflection while looking at professional development and apply it during the thesis.

To help increase my productivity I'm using "Concentrate" which is a OS X desktop app that allows you to apply the pomodoro technique. For a short amount of time (30 minutes usually) the app can close applications, block websites or perform nearly any other task to boost your productivity. When done you're allowed a five minute break before starting a new session. By applying this throughout the day I want to increase my productivity and minimise procrastination.

### Multimedia Design
Just like with concepting I want to use paper more often, and try to approach my challenges from a different angle. 

### Multimedia Production


### Quality Monitoring & Implementation
I want to apply the rapid prototyping phase to make sure our final product will be at it's best. To make sure this will be the case I want to introduce an extra step during each iteration of the rapid prototyping phase. At the end of each iteration I want to apply a set of tests to our prototype. Based on our research a list of requirements will made which the prototype has to comply to. Of this is not the case I'll find out how the prototype can be changed to conform to these requirements, and make a change in the design.

### Communication
I've written quite a lot of english reports already, but none as long as a thesis. For my semester in Sweden I had to pass the official TOEFL test which according to their website "measures your ability to use and understand English at the university level". After my semester in Sweden, I followed the international Art & Sound minor, especially further sharpening my English writing skills.

As our thesis could be of interest for international companies like Dream Industries and professionals like american scientists for example, I want our thesis to be available to an audience as broad as possible. My goal is to write a thesis that's easy and pleasant to read for native English speakers.
