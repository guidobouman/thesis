### Thesis summary
> _A chain is only as strong as its weakest link._

Lets play a game, it's called ‘Chinese Whispers’. For those of you who don't know it by name, you probably played it when you were young. The game starts with a group of people forming a chain. The first person makes up a sentence, which is whispered in the next person's ear. This continues until the sentence reaches the last person. He or she pronounces the sentence out loud. Usually the sentence changes throughout the game. The longer the chain, the higher the chance that the end result will differ from the first sentence. This is due to the increasing amount of steps where something can go wrong. 

This brings us to the quote; "A chain is only as strong as its weakest link" The problem is that information is interpreted and processed during each step of a chain. After interpretation and processing, it's passed through to the next step. It's only logical to conclude that with every step an error can occur. By reducing the the amount of steps, and thus the complexity of the chain, the chance of a error occurring, and the chain breaking, can be reduced greatly.

This does not only apply to the game ‘Chinese Whispers’, but can of course also be applied to other communication processes.

Lets presume that, based on current advancements in technology, in the nearby future it will be possible to read information from -, and write information to the human brain with computers. With that new technology it would only be a matter of time before the human brain can use services on the internet as extensions of the human brain. 

We want to slim down the complexity of the chain between the internet and humans. Currently information travels trough a lot of chains or proxies like servers, software and devices (laptops or mobile phones for example). By removing as much steps in the chain as possible, we think we could make the whole process of using internet services easier, and less prone to errors.

### Main goal
Designing a future vision and prototype in four months time, which reduces the complexity of the communication chain between the internet and the human brain by removing as much steps as possible.

### Sub goals
* Write a vision which reduces the steps in the communication chain between the human and the internet.
* Design a concept for a new internet network structure which fits the vision.
* Build and test a prototype of the network structure according to our future concept.

### Main question
How can we make the connection between a human and the internet more efficient?

### Sub questions
* How does information gets stored and exchanged within the human brain according to neuroscientists?
* What is the current status of communication & information exchange between the human brain and the internet?
* What are the differences & similarities between the human brain and the internet when looking at the certain aspects of data storage and retrieval based on our findings?
* What innovations are there in the field of digital communication and storage structures which would fit the needs of the human brain?

### Results
* Graduation plan
	* The graduation plan contains our goals, questions and planning for this thesis. 
* Research plan
	* In the research plan are the decisions made on how to do the research.
* Presentation/visualisation of our vision
	* In order to spread our vision we have to find a way how to communicate it. It maybe in the form of a presentation, a paper, book, concept art or a graphic. We’ll have to choose a congruent way. This is what we’ll be presenting to the world, so it has to be easily understandable for most of the internet users without a technical background.
* Prototype
	* After the research and completion of our vision we’re going to make a prototype. The goal of this prototype is to show a possible feature/enhancement based on our vision. It will not be a way to proof whether it works, but more a hands on presentation of our vision.
* Thesis 
	* A bundled version of the research, vision and conclusion. It’s targeted towards web professionals.

### Expectations
#### Jelle
This is my second attempt to do my bachelor thesis. I'm really hard to please and to find it difficult keep focused on one subject. My previous subject got really dull after a while. It just didn't had the innovative ingredient I'm always looking for. So after some problems I decided to ditch it and go for something more mind blowing. I want to leave school with a bang! Not with a dull, dime a dozen, thesis.

This is also my last opportunity to do something completely autonomy and under my own name with the label 'student'. In my opinion it's mostly the 'students' who make a change in this world. So yes, I want to do something which is never done before. I want to be 'arrogant' and say I've designed the new internet, just because I can as a student. I want to design a new internet which is completely neutral, just because I'm a student. I want to enjoy my autonomy now as hard as I can, just because it's my last project as a student.

I like to think about the greater images. Philosophise about hierarchy and taxonomy. When I worked on the [OpenBibliotheken](http://openbibliotheken.nl/) (OpenLibraries) project, a project about making public data more accessible I was constant thinking about making that data more persistent. The current web changes so much, things get lost. Such a shame for nice artworks and useful data. I also hated the fact the current net isn't as decentralised, things are still remotely block-able, net neutrality and such. So if been thinking a lot about persistency and how to achieve it. Revisions, proxying, decentralising, mirroring, all sort of possibilities. 

My visit to [Dream Industries](http://dreamindustries.ru/) in Russia added some spice to this. Together with Andrew I discussed the web it's current form. Not only it's persistency but also it's markup and protocol. We concluded the net is connected but not it's data. It's just some loose node's in a mesh connected through DNS names and we, the people, have to interpreted text to be able to navigate through it. It's one big dump of data. One pile of unstructured data. Not usable by machine.

When [Andrew](http://wiki.cenkes.org/Cenkes/AndrewPantyukhin) started talking about brain implements connected to the internet my mind was blown. Yes, the current web structure is totally not readable by the human brain in it's raw form. The brain would have to surf from page to page to interpreted the info. Which brings the question: how can we make a web structure which is actually readable by the brain?

I have to admit I don’t know much about the neural system. I know the basic about neurons and synapses. But I've never thought about it in combination with the internet. I want to expand my knowledge about the brain, but also about network, hierarchies and taxonomy and do something with the knowledge by connecting it to the knowledge I have about the current internet protocol. I'm getting fed up with the internet as it is now and want to do something about it.

I want to explore the realms of darknets, all sorts of database structures, semantics, namespacing and protocols to mash all the knowledge together to make a new protocol for the internet!

What I expect from my thesis is designing a prototype for the new internet. A future vision which will stay relevant for the upcoming years. Something I can actually use for my curriculum vitae. A project which does not get scratched from my CV in one or two years time because it'll be outdated by then. I hope that even by the time that the vision is outdated, I can still look back at with pride. That people will say it was genuinely revolutionary.

In the past few weeks I've been looking at [CouchApps](http://www.quirkey.com/blog/2009/09/15/sammy-js-couchdb-and-the-new-web-architecture/), and I truly believe that this is a possible future for building websites and web applications. Even though our focus is not at the future of building web applications, it is a great example of an evolution in the field internet. Another evolution I expect is that the human brain will be connected to the internet on it's own, instead of the proxies (like the phones or laptops) that we're currently using.

Efficient communications is something that has been demanding my attention for quite a while lately. How will our brain communicate with the internet, and how can we lookup and store information in an efficient way? How can we access all information in a structured way while keeping all of it decentralised / autonomous at the same time? Those are some of my interests I expect to work on during this thesis.

My goal for this thesis is to create something that allows people to do things that have never been done before. Something that pushes their imagination and stimulates them to explore the boundaries of what they used to do.

My ultimate goal in life is to be an inspiration to my own generation, and the next ones after. I would truly love to help people push the boundaries of what we thought or hoped was possible through technologies & methods I helped design. This thesis could very well be the first step towards achieving that goal.
