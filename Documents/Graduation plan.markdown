##Thesis information
###Thesis summary
The internet, as we currently know it, is composed of devices connecting to a huge network which grant us, the human, access to the web. The way we see the future, the internet will experience an evolution and actual real-life objects will become part of the internet. Even humans will start to exist on the internet as an actual object. Not through proxies like devices (phones) or services (Facebook) which is currently the standard. The internet will be like the air, everything and everyone will have it's place and we will all be connected.

There is one issue, the internet as we currently know it, is not ready for this change. The HTTP protocol has been designed 25 years ago and has it's flaws, it is not ready to support a huge change like the one we are predicting. The data is not efficiently readable by machines and it's far from natively readable by the human brain.

What we want with our thesis is to design a future vision for the internet from a technical point of view while focusing on data processing. We want to find out how this evolution of the internet can be realised. Also we want to look at what a data structure would look like that can be used for the communication with the human brain while at the same time is efficiently usable by machines.

###The problem
The internet as we currently know it is not ready to provide an efficient communication line with the human brain.

###Main goal
Designing a future vision and prototype in four months time which allow a new internet to be developed from a technical point of view on data processing.

(Specify on human brain?)

###Sub goals
* Plot down a future vision of the internet
* Design the concept protocol for a new internet
* Design a database model that's able to keep up with the human brain

*Utopia, but heck, aim for the stars:*
* Build a server that's able to operate under the new protocol
* Create a simulation of the human brain and test the new protocol

###Main question
What does an internet look like that's able to communicate with the human brain and vice versa?

###Sub questions
* What is the internet?
* How does a human brain operate?
* How does a human brain store information?
* What are existing storage technologies for databases?
* What are the requirements to communicate with the human brain?

###Hypothesis
The internet will go trough an evolution after which it will be able to interact with the human brain.

##Results
* Graduation plan
	* The graduation plan contains our goals, questions and planning for this thesis. 
* Research plan
	* In the research plan are the decisions made on how to do the research.
* Presentation/visualisation of our vision
	* In order to spread our vision we have to find a way how to communicate it. It maybe in the form of a presentation, a paper, book, concept art or a graphic. We’ll have to choose a congruent way.
* Prototype
	* After the research and completion of our vision we’re going to make a prototype. The goal of this prototype is to show a possible feature/enhancement based on our vision. It will not be a way to proof whether it works, but more a hands on presentation of our vision.
* Thesis 
	* w/ research, vision and conclusion

##Planning thesis

###Summary
Our thesis will roughly consist of 4 phases. During the first phase we will collect as much valuable information as possible. During this phase we will be focusing on gathering information on the possibilities, previous results in this field, and what is still lacking. As a part of this phase we will conduct interviews with experts in the fields of Neural Communication, Data Storage and Existing Data Protocols. We are hoping these interviews will help us in creating a strong view of the possibilities as they are right now, and the changes or developments required to realise a better internet.

During the next phase we will start looking at the possible solutions to problems found during the first research phase, and the first version of our vision will be developed. Looking for possible solutions and designing a vision will require us to apply rapid prototyping where we will quickly test our proposed solutions and try the validity of our vision with simulated tests. We don't expect our first vision to be a solid and future proof one. That's why we hope applying rapid prototyping will help us reach our goal of making a vision that will be used as one of the leading documents on the future of the internet, even in 5 to 10 years time.

To support our future vision, we would really like to design a proof of concept which will show people the possibilities of an enhanced internet. This is what we'll focus on during the third phase. Because our future vision will most probably take into account technologies currently unavailable, we can't hope to build a perfect working prototype of the evolved internet. But at the very least we want to prove the usability of the vision that we will have designed in 4 months time. The proof we want to provide is based on two designs. First, a protocol that's ready to communicate with the human brain when the electronics are too. And second, a database system that's able to keep up with the human brain when looking at relational links.

For the last phase, we will be finalising our thesis. The thesis summary will be part of our focus. Also will we use this phase to reflect on ourselves and the project. Thinking about what we have learned, and how can we use this knowledge in the upcoming years. This will be our one chance to gain a head start on everyone else in the business.

###Activity per competency
##Research & Innovation
###Tasks
Before getting started on the thesis we need to find the unambiguous questions behind our problem and setup related goals. This required so we can focus our attention while researching on the core problem.

We need to gather information about existing web platforms, structures, databases and thus need to do research. We’ll be collecting this information through interviews and desk research. Prior to doing the research we’ll have to write a research plan and find out how to do proper interviews. This knowledge will be included in the Research plan together with all the choices we make prior to doing the research.

###Results
* Interviews
* Research plan
* Advice/Vision 
* Goal set
* Thesis plan
* Research document


##Concepting
### Tasks
Based research we are going to create a vision which in account the needs of the intended uses. Because we’re going to use the rapid prototyping method the vision and concept will be thoroughly tested on it’s fitness and improved where needed.
After distilling our vision from the research we have to make the vision concrete by making a proper concept  and a visualisation of the concept. The concept should be easy to understand by others with little knowledge on the subject. 

### Results
* Vision document
* Vision presentation

##Multimedia Design
### Tasks
We’re going to design a structure which should be thoroughly documented so it can easily be implemented by others in the future when technology is ready. Together with the Vision document will the Design document be the main product of our thesis.

### Results
* The technical design
* Design document
* A suggestion for future development of the internet


##Multimedia Production
###  Tasks
We’ll be creating a prototype out of the vision, concept, structure and technical design. 

### Results
* Creating a prototype/structure
* Creating a proof of concept


##Quality Monitoring & Implementation
### Tasks
Because we’re going to be rapid prototyping, we’re constantly testing out our product, the vision. This way research will continue while developing and thus constantly improve our product.  This will result in an even better vision & proof of concept after testing.

### Results
* A logbook full of choices, problems we’ve stumbled upon and their solutions.
* A lot of git commits ;)

##Communication
### Tasks
We’ll be writing all documents in English because we want reach a big audience and open source during our process. This way it will be easy for anyone to follow our progression and findings through Github. 

### Results
* Full thesis in flawless english
* A presentation
* A suggestion for future development of the internet
* All open sourced for the world to see (and use or fork) on Github.


##Growth & Reflection
### Tasks
Prior to starting our thesis we’ve written down our individual expectations and goals. This way we can constantly secure our focus on the progress and make the most out of ourselves as possible. By setting ambitious and bold goals we keep ourselves motivated and will bring a step closer to world domination.

During the thesis we’ll be on our thesis we’ll be reflection on our progression and results. We’ll bundle this afterwards and write a concluding reflection on the whole project.

### Results
* Thesis plan
* A conclusion in the thesis
* Reflection
* And git log with pictures
