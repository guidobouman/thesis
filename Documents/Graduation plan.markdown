##Thesis information
###Thesis summary
The internet, as we currently know it, is composed of devices connecting to a huge network which grant us, the human, access to the web. The way we see the future, the internet will experience an evolution and actual real-life objects will become part of the internet. Even humans will start to exist on the internet as an actual object. Not through proxies like devices (phones) or services (Facebook) which is currently the standard. The internet will be like the air, everything and everyone will have it's place and we will all be connected.

There is one issue, the internet as we currently know it, is not ready for this change. The HTTP protocol has been designed 25 years ago and has it's flaws, it is not ready to support a huge change like the one we are predicting. The data is not efficiently readable by machines and it's far from natively readable by the human brain.

What we want with our thesis is to design a future vision for the internet from a technical point of view while focusing on data processing. We want to find out how this evolution of the internet can be realised. Also we want to look at what a data structure would look like that can be used for the communication with the human brain while at the same time is efficiently usable by machines.

###The problem
The internet as we currently know it is not ready to provide an efficient communication line with the human brain.

###Main goal
Designing a future vision and prototype in four months time which allow a new internet to be developed from a technical point of view on data processing.

(Specify on human brain?)

###Sub goals
* Plot down a future vision of the internet
* Design the concept protocol for a new internet
* Design a database model that's able to keep up with the human brain

*Utopia, but heck, aim for the stars:*
* Build a server that's able to operate under the new protocol
* Create a simulation of the human brain and test the new protocol

###Main question
What does an internet look like that's able to communicate with the human brain and vice versa?

###Sub questions
* What is the internet?
* How does a human brain operate?
* How does a human brain store information?
* What are existing storage technologies for databases?
* What are the requirements to communicate with the human brain?

###Hypothesis
The internet will go trough an evolution after which it will be able to interact with the human brain.

##Results
* Graduation plan
	* The graduation plan contains our goals, questions and planning for this thesis. 
* Research plan
	* In the research plan are the decisions made on how to do the research.
* Presentation/visualisation of our vision
	* In order to spread our vision we have to find a way how to communicate it. It maybe in the form of a presentation, a paper, book, concept art or a graphic. We’ll have to choose a congruent way.
* Prototype
	* After the research and completion of our vision we’re going to make a prototype. The goal of this prototype is to show a possible feature/enhancement based on our vision. It will not be a way to proof whether it works, but more a hands on presentation of our vision.
* Thesis 
	* w/ research, vision and conclusion
