This is my second attempt to do my bachelor thesis. I'm really hard to please and to find it difficult keep focused on one subject. My previous subject got really dull after a while. It just didn't had the innovative ingredient I'm always looking for. So after some problems I decided to ditch it and go for something more mind blowing. I want to leave school with a bang! Not with a dull, dime a dozen, thesis.


This is also my last opportunity to do something completely autonomy and under my own name with the label 'student'. In my opinion it's mostly the 'students' who make a change in this world. So yes, I want to do something which is never done before. I want to be 'arrogant' and say I've designed the new internet, just because I can as a student. I want to design a new internet which is completely neutral, just because I'm a student. I want to enjoy my autonomy now as hard as I can, just because it's my last project as a student.


I like to think about the greater images. Philosophise about hierarchy and taxonomy. When I worked on the OpenBibliotheken (OpenLibraries) project, a project about making public data more accessible I was constant thinking about making that data more persistent. The current web changes so much, things get lost. Such a shame for nice artworks and useful data. I also hated the fact the current net isn't as decentralised, things are still remotely block-able, net neutrality and such. So if been thinking a lot about persistency and how to achieve it. Revisions, proxying, decentralising, mirroring, all sort of possibilities. 


My visit to Dream Industries in Russia added some .. to this. Together with Andrew I discussed the web it's current form. Not only it's persistency but also it's markup and protocol. We concluded the net is connected but not it's data. It's just some loose node's in a mesh connected through DNS names and we, the people, have to interpreted text to be able to navigate through it. It's one big dump of data. One pile of unstructured data. Not usable by machine.


When Andrew started talking about brain implements connected to the internet my mind was blown. Yes, the current web structure is totally not readable by the human brain in it's raw form. The brain would have to surf from page to page to interpreted the info. Which brings the question: how can we make a web structure which is actually readable by the brain?


I have to admit I don't know shit about the neural system. I know the basic about synapses and ... But i've never thought about it in combination with the internet. I want to expand my knowledge about the brain, but also about network, hierarchies and taxonomy and do something with the knowledge by connecting it to the knowledge I have about the current internet protocol. I'm getting fed up with the internet as it is now and want to do something about it.


I want to explore the realms of darknets, all sorts of database structures, semantics, namespacing and protocols to mash all the knowledge together to make a new protocol for the internet!
