#Activity per competency
##Research & Innovation
###Tasks
Before getting started on the thesis we need to find the unambiguous questions behind our problem and setup related goals. This required so we can focus our attention while researching on the core problem.

We need to gather information about existing web platforms, structures, databases and thus need to do research. We’ll be collecting this information through interviews and desk research. Prior to doing the research we’ll have to write a research plan and find out how to do proper interviews. This knowledge will be included in the Research plan together with all the choices we make prior to doing the research.

###Results
* Interviews
* Research plan
* Advice/Vision 
* Goal set
* Thesis plan
* Research document


##Concepting
### Tasks
Based research we are going to create a vision which in account the needs of the intended uses. Because we’re going to use the rapid prototyping method the vision and concept will be thoroughly tested on it’s fitness and improved where needed.
After distilling our vision from the research we have to make the vision concrete by making a proper concept  and a visualisation of the concept. The concept should be easy to understand by others with little knowledge on the subject. 

### Results
* Vision document
* Vision presentation

##Multimedia Design
### Tasks
We’re going to design a structure which should be thoroughly documented so it can easily be implemented by others in the future when technology is ready. Together with the Vision document will the Design document be the main product of our thesis.

### Results
* The technical design
* Design document
* A suggestion for future development of the internet


##Multimedia Production
###  Tasks
We’ll be creating a prototype out of the vision, concept, structure and technical design. 

### Results
* Creating a prototype/structure
* Creating a proof of concept


##Quality Monitoring & Implementation
### Tasks
Because we’re going to be rapid prototyping, we’re constantly testing out our product, the vision. This way research will continue while developing and thus constantly improve our product.  This will result in an even better vision & proof of concept after testing.

### Results
* A logbook full of choices, problems we’ve stumbled upon and their solutions.
* A lot of git commits ;)

##Communication
### Tasks
We’ll be writing all documents in English because we want reach a big audience and open source during our process. This way it will be easy for anyone to follow our progression and findings through Github. 

### Results
* Full thesis in flawless english
* A presentation
* A suggestion for future development of the internet
* All open sourced for the world to see (and use or fork) on Github.


##Growth & Reflection
### Tasks
Prior to starting our thesis we’ve written down our individual expectations and goals. This way we can constantly secure our focus on the progress and make the most out of ourselves as possible. By setting ambitious and bold goals we keep ourselves motivated and will bring a step closer to world domination.

During the thesis we’ll be on our thesis we’ll be reflection on our progression and results. We’ll bundle this afterwards and write a concluding reflection on the whole project.

### Results
* Thesis plan
* A conclusion in the thesis
* Reflection
* And git log with pictures
