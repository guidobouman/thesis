#Activity per competention
##Research & Innovation
###Tasks
We need to gather information about existing web platforms, structures, databases and thus need to do research. We’ll be collecting this information through interviews and desk research. Prior doing the research we’ll have to write a research and find out how to do proper interviews. This knowledge will be included in the Research plan together with all the choices we make prior to doing the research.

###Results
* Interviews
* Research plan
* Advice/Vision 
* Goal set


##Concepting
