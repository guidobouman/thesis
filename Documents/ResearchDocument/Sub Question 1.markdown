# Anatomy of a human brain
The brain is an immensely complex part of the human body. Figerally it consists out of many wires, called synapses, and ‘tiny deciding machines’, neurons, about 100 billion of them. [p. 75][#Chorost:2011]
Neurons are wired in a mesh network with via synapses. Neurons are able to fire and enable or disable connected neurons. “The job of a neuron is to accept spikes of electricity—called action potentials—from its dendrites. Depending on that input, it “decides” whether to send an action potential of its own to other neurons via its axon.” [p. 148][#Chorost:2011]

Past memories and realtime experience are stored the same in the human brain, although the parts are divided. “Prediction is not just one of the things your brain does. It is the primary function of the neocortex, and the foundation of intelligence.” [p. 169][#Hawkins:2003] The neocortex is the newest part of the brain in evolution and is situated in the higher levels of the brain. “What is actually happening flows up, and what you expect to be happening flows down.” [p. 89][#Hawkins:2003]
Plainly the hippocampus is for encoding, the cortex for storing. [p. 283][#Chorost:2011]
