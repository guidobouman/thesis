# Anatomy of a human brain
The brain is an immensely complex part of the human body. 

A neuron is basically a tiny deciding machine. The number of these tiny deciding machines in your head is in some dispute, but 100 billion is the number most commonly given. [p. 75][#Chorost:2011]

Most of the neurons in the neocortex have between 1,000 and 10,000 synaptic connections with other neurons. Elsewhere in the brain, in the cerebellum, one type of neuron has 150,000 to 200,000 synaptic connections with other neurons. [p. 77][#Chorost:2011]

“What is actually happening flows up, and what you expect to be happening flows down.” [p. 89][#Hawkins:2003]
