## Sub question 1
> How does information get stored and exchanged within the human brain according to neurologists?

### How does the brain work?
#### Anatomy of a human brain
The brain is an immensely complex part of the human body. Figerally it consists out of many wires, called synapses, and ‘tiny deciding machines’, neurons, about 100 billion of them. [p. 75][#Chorost:2011]
Neurons are wired in a mesh network with via synapses. Neurons are able to fire and enable or disable connected neurons. “The job of a neuron is to accept spikes of electricity—called action potentials—from its dendrites. Depending on that input, it “decides” whether to send an action potential of its own to other neurons via its axon.” [p. 148][#Chorost:2011]

#### Memory storage
Memories are stored in the brain as hierarchical patterns. For example if you would think of a memory containing an earthquake the pattern could be like this: Startling → Disturbing motion → Shaking → On Church and Market [p. 285](#Chorost:2011) Interpret the objects in this hierarchy as neurons firing each other, the lines as synapses. 

#### Learning
If you have learned something you have basically made a memory more permanent in your brain. You’ve strengthened the synapses between the neurons which make the pattern of the memory. The strength of a synapse and thus the strength of a memory is expressed in weights [TODO: source].
If you want to learn something the job is to repeatedly fire the pattern of neurons and strengthen the synapses. This repeating has to done in order to learn. So instead of what the movie The Matrix states, it’s not possible to learn something, for example flying an helicoptor, within seconds. Neurons have to fire repeatitly first. [TODO: add dexter’s lab video]

Another thing is when it comes to learning is your reference [TODO: referentiekader] is the limit of what you’re able to learn. This sounds weird because learning is all about broading your reference, but when you think of it how you’re able to learn; you’re not able to fire neurons/pattern which arent there. So if you want to ‘download’ data into the brain you would have to do it with triggering the existing neurons and make new patterns.[TODO: source]

#### Confabulation
Past memories and realtime experiences are stored the same in the human brain, although the parts are divided. “Prediction is not just one of the things your brain does. It is the primary function of the neocortex, and the foundation of intelligence.” [p. 169][#Hawkins:2003] By retrieving past memories from the neocortex the brain predicts what happens realtime. This is how details can be filled in without having to need to interpret them again. This is called confabulation. “What is actually happening flows up, and what you expect to be happening flows down.” [p. 89][#Hawkins:2003] “Plainly the hippocampus is for encoding, the cortex for storing.” [p. 283][#Chorost:2011]

### Human Brain vs. the Web
This thesis is about the internet, so let’s take the above knowledge and mash it together with the knowledge we have about the internet and compare them.

#### Structure
##### Web
Decentralised
##### Storage
Nodebased storage
#### Persistency
Longterm Shortterm

#### Learning
Plastisticy
#### Computation
