## Sub question 3
> What are the differences & similarities between the human brain and the internet?

### Requirements of a intelligent machine
> According to functionalism, being intelligent or having a mind is purely a property of organization and has nothing inherently to do with what you’re organized out of. A mind exists in any system whose constituent parts have the right causal relationship with each other, but those parts can just as validly be neurons, silicon chips, or something else. [p. 75][#Hawkins:2004]

### Capacity
Upper limit, neurogenesis vs modular computers

> Capacity is the first issue. Let’s say the cortex has 32 trillion synapses. If we represented each synapse using only two bits (giving us four possible values per synapse) and each byte has eight bits (so one byte could represent four synapses), then we would need roughly 8 trillion bytes of memory. A hard drive on a personal computer today has 100 billion bytes, so we would need about eighty of today’s hard drives to have the same amount of memory as a human cortex.[p. 384][#Hawkins:2004]

### Centralisation / Decentralisation
Centralised mind, decentralised data vs decentralised computer network

### Computational power
> Neurons are quite slow compared to the transistors in a computer. A neuron collects inputs from its synapses, and combines these inputs together to decide when to output a spike to other neurons. A typical neuron can do this and reset itself in about five milliseconds (5 ms), or around two hundred times per second. This may seem fast, but a modern silicon-based computer can do one billion operations in a second. [p. 127][#Hawkins:2004]

> No matter how many workers you hire, the problem cannot be solved in less time than it takes to walk a million steps. The same is true for parallel computers. [p. 130][#Hawkins:2004]

### Data storage
Data on the internet is served through pages/documents. Often these pages are scripted in html and linked together with hyperlinks. This way you’re able to browse from page to page end collect your information. Hyperlinks enable you to browse from one server to an other. So the internet is plainly a bunch of file cabinets, pointing to each other within documents. The DNS protocol allows it to directly access a document through a domain name, but the name is not tied to the content. 

The brain doesn’t have pages or domain names. The links are different as well. Patterns are the storage, not the nodes (or in the case of the internet the pages). The internet itself doesn’t value the storage like the brain does with its weights on synapses. Although you could say that Google’s Pagerank tries to emulate this by storing information about the importance of links by looking how often they are linked and accessed. Google’s pagerank is used to order its results in it’s search engine on importance. But still it doesn’t make a hyperlink a synapse.

### Data retrieval speed
Only few hundred steps vs millions of cycles

### Learning
Able to make sense of any pattern vs everything defined on forehand

### Persistence
Forgetting information vs backups
(long term short term)

### Portability
Extremely portable, always with you, yet not transferable vs not so portable but easily transferable

### Sharing
Conversations vs literal copy, paste, e-mail
