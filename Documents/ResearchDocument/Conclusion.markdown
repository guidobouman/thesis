## Conclusion

### Comparison based on properties
Brains vs The Internet, a property comparison.

#### Data storage
Short therm vs long therm

#### Data retrieval speed
Only few hundred steps vs millions of cycles

#### Learning
Able to make sense of any pattern vs everything defined on forehand

#### Capacity
Upper limit, neurogenesis vs modular computers

#### Persistence
Forgetting information vs backups

#### Centralisation / Decentralisation
Centralised mind, decentralised data vs decentralised computer network

#### Portability
Extremely portable, always with you, yet not transferable vs not so portable but easily transferable

#### Sharing
Conversations vs literal copy, paste, e-mail

### Combination
In what fields can the internet support the brain and vice-versa?

### Proposed vision
Best of both worlds, where the brain has this, the internet has to adopt. Where the internet has that, it can enhance the brain.
