## Sub question 2
> What is the current status of communication & information exchange between the human brain and computers / the internet?

### MRI & EEG
These are two vastly interesting techniques which allow us to read information from the human brain. Unfortunately they're unidirectional which means they're only able to read information from the mind, and not write, which we would require.

### Optogenetics
This is a fairly new technique and best suited for reading and writing to the brain. By altering the genetics of individual neurons in the brain scientists are able to see and alter the state of individual neurons with lasers.

By inserting a controlled virus into the brain, certain neurons will be genetically modified which will in turn make the neurons light dependent. This allows the neuron to be controlled and read by light. [05:55][#Boyden:2011]

Devices for Optogenetics are fairly low cost and itâ€™s possible to utilise this technology with with a laser and some cheap electronics like an Arduino. [][#SNG:2011]

### Neuromorphic microcontrollers
Neuromorphic microcontrollers are silicon chips which try to mimic the way the human brain works by using memristors & bipolar spin neurons. Current progress in this field is a working chip that's able to play pong like a human does, and which is able to complete digits partially drawn by humans.

The scientists working on the DARPA SyNAPSE program, which is one of the main Neuromorphic chip projects, think this technology could break Moore's law. Looking at their planning they're planning to go roughly five times as fast as Moore's law. Of course this is a new technology where huge leaps can be made in relatively short amount of time. But it seems that they're confident that neuromorphic machines can be the solution to breaking free of Moore's law.  [][#Darpa:2012]
