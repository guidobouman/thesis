## Sub question 2
> What is the current status of communication & information exchange between the human brain and the internet?

### MRI & EEG
MRI & EEG are two vastly interesting techniques which allow us to read information from the human brain. This is not a read / write technology, so unfortunately not interesting to us.

### Optogenetics
This is currently the most promising technology which could allow us to enable or disable specific neurons inside the human brain using light. Enabling and disabling neurons is how the human brain currently operates.

### Neuromorphic microcontrollers
Neuromorphic microcontrollers are silicon chips which work much like a neural network.

### Future techniques in terms of time

BCI’s are devices which enable to read the mind by translating electronical activity to signals which can be interpreted by computers. 

In order to interact with the brain we need some sort of method to read and write to brain. There are a few ways to do this. This will be a short introduction on these techniques to get a bit idea on how various BCIs work.

EEG, also known as Electroencephalography was one of the first way to read certain brainwaves of the mind. Scientist discovered there’s electrical activity in the human brain. By sensing the electrical field around the human brain scientists were able to discover difference frequencies. By monitoring these frequencies it is possible to conclude a certain state of the mind. It’s resolution is very low and thus it’s only possible to sense a couple of states.
This method  is unidirectional which means it’s only possible to read the mind and not able to manipulate it and therefor not applicable for the World Wide Mind.

EEG devices are low budget and available on the consumer market for around $100.  The Neurosky MindWave is one example of an EEG device which allows you the sense different states of the brain and is used for al sorts of multimedia purposes.

MRI, also known as Magnetic resonance imaging is an other way of reading the brain. By using a large powerful magnet a ‘photo’ is created of various tissues in the human body. On this photo the differences between various brain tissues is seen and it’s possible to make conclusions on types of tissues.

The resolution of MRI is greater than EEG’s because its able to see the difference between tissues. The downside of MRI is you will need lots of power and a big magnet. So it’s not portable and it’s very expensive. A MRI scanner costs about one million dollar.

Optogenetics is a fairly new technique and best suiting for reading and writing to the brain. By altering the genetics of individual neurons in the brain scientists are able to see and alter the state of individual neurons with lasers.

By inserting a controlled virus into the brain, certain neurons will be geneticly modified and will make the neurons light dependent. This allows the neuron to be controlled and read by light. [video][1]

Devices for optogenetics are fairly low cost and it’s possible with a precise laser and some cheap electronics like an arduino. [6]
