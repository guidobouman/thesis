# Thesis summary

## Dutch

In de toekomst worden we één met het internet. Het internet bestaat dan niet meer uit beeldschermen zoals we het nu kennen, maar het wij zijn het internet. Het internet bestaat niet alleen maar meer uit data, maar ook fysieke dingen. Het internet is dan net als lucht. Iedereen heeft zijn plaats en iedereen is verbonden. 

Het huidige internet zoals wij dat kennen is niet geschikt. De 25 jaar oude protocollen en markups zijn gedateerd en niet bruikbaar in de filosofie. De data zijn bijvoorbeeld slecht tot niet leesbaar door machines en laat staan ons brein.

Wat wij met ons afstuderen willen is het neerzetten van een toekomstvisie van het internet vanuit een technologisch oogpunt. We willen uitzoeken hoe dit gerealiseerd kan worden op gebied van data verwerking. Zo willen we kijken of we datastructuur neer kunnen zetten die op een efficiënte manier te gebruiken is tijdens de communicatie met het brein en bruikbaar door machines. 

## English

The internet, as we currently know it, is composed of devices connecting to a huge network which grant us, the human, access to the web. The way we see the future, the internet will experience an evolution and actual real-life objects will become part of the internet. Even humans will start to exist on the internet as an actual object. Not through proxies like devices (phones) or services (Facebook) which is currently the standard. The internet will be like the air, everything and everyone will have it's place and we will all be connected.

There is one issue, the internet as we currently know it, is not ready for this change. The HTTP protocol has been designed 25 years ago and has it's flaws, it is not ready to support a huge change like the one we are predicting. The data is not efficiently readable by machines and it's far from natively readable by the human brain.

What we want with our thesis is to design a future vision for the internet from a technical point of view while focusing on data processing. We want to find out how this evolution of the internet can be realised. Also we want to look at what a data structure would look like that can be used for the communication with the human brain while at the same time is efficiently usable by machines.

Since our pre-research  we have formed a more concrete vision. The following is a rewritten thesis summary.

Optogenetics is one of the possible technologies that will drive the digital connection of the human brain with the outside world. We presume it will be able to alter neurons in the human brain on a large scale with computers and thus alter information in the brain. The question is, how do we prepare a structure / network / architecture that the human brain will be able to connect to, and that will allow it to exchange information with other brains / people? 

Lets presume that in the future it will be possible to connect the human brain entirely to a computer. Getting information from and to the internet would be possible. We want to design a structure what would facilitate an network for the human brain to connect to and

We assume that in the nearby future human brains will be connected to the internet. We expect that it will be inefficient for the human brain to crawl the current internet consisting of a wide range of different technologies currently used on the internet. (Think images, audio, css styled html pages, different api's or open databases) Our goal is to provide yet another technology that will present all of this information in a structured way. We think that by providing this technology we will help the human brain access publicly available information more efficiently.

Lets presume that, based on current advancements in technology, in the nearby future it will be possible to read information from -, and write information to the human brain with computers. With that new technology it would only be a matter of time before the human brain can use services on the internet as extensions of the human brain. Take for example an online encyclopaedia (wikipedia) to quickly access vast amounts of information during conversations, or an online calendar to remember all of our appointments.

This new technology would vastly decrease the need for smartphones or tablets as they currently are our proxies (or windows) to the internet. At the same time this [new technology / future vision] raises a lot of questions. For this thesis we want to focus on one of them: What is the [best / most efficient / easiest] way to [provide / present] the vast amounts of information & services available on the internet to the human brain? Would an restful JSON api suffice, or would a new technology be required?
