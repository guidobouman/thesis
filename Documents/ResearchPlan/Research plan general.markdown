### Explanation
Just as with any other research we’re doing research to gather information whereupon we can base our vision. After making our vision we’re going build an concept upon this vision. For this concept we’ll need some research as well but this will be more parallel to the process of creating, this is called Rapid Prototyping. This way our research is divided in two: the standard research and development through Rapid Prototyping.
