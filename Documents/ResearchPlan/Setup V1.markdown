## How does information gets stored and exchanged within the human brain according to neuroscientists?
### Explenation (Verklaring: waarom)
We need to know how the human brain operates before we can make any predictions on this subject. Neuroscientists have formed their theories / knowledge based on studies of factual data, thus can provide us the most relevant & trustworthy information.

### Delimitation (Afbakening: wat)
We chose information storage and exchange as the two focal points because we want to focus on the needs of the human brain related to the internet.

### Research methods (Onderzoeksmethodieken: hoe)
We'll be conducting open interviews in conversation form with neuroscientists. These interviews will have strict subjects we want to talk about.

The interviews will contain (but are not limited to) the following subjects:
* His vision
* 

### Sources (Bronnen / waar gaan we onderzoeken: waar / wie)
* Scientist 1
* Scientist 2
* Scientist 3
* Scientist 4
