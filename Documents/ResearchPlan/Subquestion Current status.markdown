### What is the current status of communication & information exchange between the human brain and the internet?

#### Explanation (Verklaring: waarom)
We chose this question to find out what progress has already been made on this subject and if we can use it to our advantage.

#### Delimitation (Afbakening: wat)
First we need to find out if a straight tap into the human brain already exists. If it doesn't we need to find out which projected methods are realistic, in what time frame they could be realised.

We're not taking the regular human senses into consideration because we're looking for a straight two-way connection to the human brain. If one is not available, we don't think it's a proper alternative to interact indirectly with the human brain trough the use of "dream machines" or "dosing" for example.

#### Research methods (Onderzoeksmethodieken: hoe)
We'll use a light form of desk research, combined with interviews.

#### Sources (Bronnen / waar gaan we onderzoeken: waar / wie)
Reading book World Wide Mind.

Interview with Nijholt because he's an expert on interaction with the human brain through BCIâ€™s and is also interested in the World Wide Mind.

#### Planning (Tijdsframe: hoeveel tijd?)
A total of one week for the following:
* Reading World Wide Mind
* Preparing for interviews
* Conducting interviews
* Transcribing and processing the interview data
* Researching after interviews (covering sources)
* Writing a conclusion

#### Results (Verwachte resultaten)
We expect to be able to create a comparison of available and predicted methods that allow a direct two-way information exchange to take place between a human brain and a computer without the use of human senses.
