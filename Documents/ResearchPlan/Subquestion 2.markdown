## Sub question 2
> What is the current status of communication & information exchange between the human brain and the internet?

### Explanation
We chose this question to find out what progress has already been made on this subject and if we can use it to our advantage.

### Delimitation
First we need to find out if a straight tap into the human brain already exists. If it doesn't we need to find out which projected methods are realistic, in what time frame they could be realised.

We're not taking the regular human senses into consideration because we're looking for a straight two-way connection to the human brain. If one is not available, we don't think it's a proper alternative to interact indirectly with the human brain trough the use of "dream machines" or "dosing" for example.

### Research methods
We'll use a light form of desk research, combined with interviews.

The interviews will be semi structured with the following subjects:
* The current progress on connecting human brains to the internet
* Wether or not a straight tap in the human brain is (soon) possible
* Wether or not a connection with only the human brain will suffice

### Sources
Interview with the following people:
* Larry Smarr
	* An industry leader & visionary on connecting the human body to the internet.
	* Research on which technologies could be available, don't come in empty handed.
* Dream Industries Employee

Further researching based on new insights gained from interview.

### Planning
A total of one week for the following:
* Research current advances in technology
* Preparing for interview
* Conducting interviews
* Transcribing and processing the interview data
* Researching new knowledge after interviews
* Writing a conclusion

### Results
We expect to be able to create a comparison of available and predicted methods that allow a direct two-way information exchange to take place between a human brain and a computer without the use of human senses.
