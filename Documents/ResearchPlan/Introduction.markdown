## Introduction
### Explanation
Just as with any other project we’re conducting research to gather information on which we can base our vision. After creating our vision we’re going to build a concept based on this vision. For this concept we’ll need some research as well but this will be more parallel to the process of creating, this is called Rapid Prototyping. This way our research is divided in two parts: the standard research and development through Rapid Prototyping.

### Questions
