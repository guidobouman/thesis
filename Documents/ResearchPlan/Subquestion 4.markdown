## Sub Question 4
> What innovations are there in the field of digital communication and storage structures which would fit the needs of the human brain?

### Explanation
Once we've found out how the human brain operates and what it's requirements are, we can ask industry leaders which technologies would fit those needs.

### Delimitation
This question can be divided in two sections, the first part will look at the relevant innovations, the other will look at which of hem could fit the needs of the human brain.

Technologies we consider interesting for data storage are [Graph Databases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database) or [Document-oriented Databases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database). Based on our personal experience we'll exclude all techniques related to [relational databases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) as most types of relational databases don't even support replication or high availability.

### Research methods
We'll use a light form of desk research, combined with interviews.

The interviews will be semi structured with the following subjects:
* Current standards in the interviewee's discipline
* Why they became the current standard
* Innovations in the interviewee's discipline
* What's interesting about those innovations
* Interviewee's expected future developments

### Sources
Interview with the following people:
* Werner Vogels
	* CTO Amazon
	* Knows a lot about distributed storage & big data
* Dream Industries Employee

### Planning
A total of one week for the following:
* Researching different methods of data storage & communication
* Preparing for interviews
* Conducting interviews
* Transcribing and processing the interview data
* Researching new knowledge after interviews
* Writing a conclusion

### Results
Two lists of interesting technologies, one with the currently available ones and one with projected / upcoming technologies which are currently in development, or scheduled to be developed soon.

On top of that, one list of evaluated but non-interesting results, with the reasoning why they're not interesting enough.
