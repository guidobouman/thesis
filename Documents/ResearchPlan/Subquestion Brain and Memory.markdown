### Sub question 1
#### How does information get stored and exchanged within the human brain according to neuroscientists?

#### Explanation
We need to know how the human brain operates before we can make any predictions on this subject. Neuroscientists have formed their theories / knowledge based on studies of factual data, thus can provide us the most relevant & trustworthy information.

#### Delimitation
We chose information storage and exchange as the two focal points because we want to focus on the needs of the human brain related to the internet.

#### Research methods
##### Interviews
We'll be conducting open interviews in conversation form with neuroscientists. These interviews will have strict subjects we want to talk about.

The interviews will contain (but are not limited to) the following subjects:
* His vision on the internet in relation to the human brain
* Description about storage/memory of the brain
* Ideas on how to format the data for exchange with the brain

##### Desk research
The desk research will be plain and short because we want to retrieve most of the info through interviews because that’s more efficient.

##### People
###### PROF.DR. C.M.A. Pennartz 
Did many interesting researches. For example this one on the human brain’s [semantic memory](http://thesis.bo.lt/the_construction_of_semantic_memory_grammar_based_representations_learned_from_relational_episodic_information). Expert on Neural Networks, Neural coding, Memory. Hope to gather knowledge on structure of data. 

###### PROF.DR.IR. A. Nijholt
Expert on interaction with the human brain through BCI’s. Is interested in the World Wide Mind.

#### Planning
A total of one week for the following:
* Reading World Wide Mind
* Preparing for interviews
* Conducting interviews
* Transcribing and processing the interview data
* Researching after interviews (covering sources)
* Writing a conclusion

#### Results
* A list with needs of the human brain to communicate with the internet.
* Basic knowledge about the human brain it’s storage structure.
