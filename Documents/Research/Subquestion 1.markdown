## Sub question 1
> How does information get stored and exchanged within the human brain according to neurologists?

### How does the brain work?
#### Anatomy of a human brain
The brain is an immensely complex part of the human body. It consists out of many wires, called synapses, and ‘tiny deciding machines’, neurons, about 100 billion of them. [Chorost, 2011, p. 75][#Chorost:2011]
Neurons are wired in a mesh network trough the use of synapses. Neurons are able to fire and enable or disable connected neurons. “The job of a neuron is to accept spikes of electricity—called action potentials—from its dendrites. Depending on that input, it “decides” whether to send an action potential of its own to other neurons via its axon.” [Chorost, 2011, p. 148][#Chorost:2011]

#### Memory storage
Memories are stored in the brain as spatial and sequential patterns. For example if you would think of a memory containing an earthquake the pattern could be like this: Startling → Disturbing motion → Shaking → On Church and Market [Chorost, 2011, p. 285][#Chorost:2011] Interpret the objects in this hierarchy as neurons firing each other, the lines as synapses. 

> Your memory of the alphabet is a sequence of patterns. It isn’t something stored or recalled in an instant or in an arbitrary order. [Hawkins, 2004, p. 137][#Hawkins:2004]

 Memory sequences are retrieved exactly the way they are learned. Try spelling the alphabet backwards, you’ll find it very hard, just like learning a new language. 
 
#### Learning
If you have learned something you have basically made a memory more permanent in your brain; You’ve strengthened the synapses between the neurons which make the pattern of the memory. The strength of a synapse and thus the strength of a memory is expressed in weights [TODO: source].

If you want to learn something the job is to repeatedly fire the pattern of neurons and strengthen the synapses. This repeating has to be done in order to learn. So instead of what the movie The Matrix states, it’s not possible to learn something, for example learning within seconds how to operate a helicopter or how to perform a martial art. Neurons have to fire repeatedly first.

Another thing is when it comes to learning is: your reference is the limit of what you’re able to learn. This sounds weird because learning is all about broadening your reference. But when you think of it, how you’re able to learn; you’re not able to fire neurons/pattern which aren't there. So if you want to ‘download’ data into the brain you would have to do it with triggering the existing neurons and make new patterns. [Hawkins, 2004][#Hawkins:2004]

[TODO: Gevolgen]

The hippocampus plays a big role in the formation of new memories. The hippocampus exists in both parts of the brain and is directly connected to the neocortex. Imagine it as a buffer before writing into the neocortex, the hard drive. Without the hippocampus it is impossible to store new memories, while it’s possible to still remember things before the defect.

#### Confabulation
> Prediction is not just one of the things your brain does. It is the primary function of the neocortex, and the foundation of intelligence. [Hawkins, 2004, p. 169][#Hawkins:2004]

Past memories and realtime experiences are stored the same way in the human brain, although the parts are divided. By retrieving past memories from the neocortex the brain predicts what happens realtime. This is how details can be filled in without having to need to interpret them again. This is called confabulation. 
“What is actually happening flows up, and what you expect to be happening flows down.” [Hawkins, 2004, p. 89][#Hawkins:2004] 

“Plainly the hippocampus is for encoding, the cortex for storing.” [Chorost, 2011, p. 283][#Chorost:2011]

#### Neuroplasticity
Brain plasticity, or neuroplasticity, is the ability of the human brain to change over time. [Michelon, 2008][#Michelon:2008] This is an amazing feature which allows the human brain to move certain functions to other parts of the brain.

In one of his articles Michelon [2008][#Michelon:2008] writes the following:
> A surgeon in his 50s suffers a stroke. His left arm is paralyzed. During his rehabilitation, his good arm and hand are immobilized, and he is set to cleaning tables. The task is at first impossible. Then slowly the bad arm remembers how too move. He learns to write again, to play tennis again: the functions of the brain areas killed in the stroke have transferred themselves to healthy regions!

While this is a vital function of the brain, this also means any future technology like optogenetics -- we'll talk more about that later on in this research -- can't rely on any of the brain's functions being present in one specific area. On the other hand because the brain is so flexible, we have grounds to believe that the human brain will be able to adjust to what ever is being fed to it.

#### Neurogenesis
Just moving functions from one part of the brain to another part of the brain wouldn't be enough. To help facilitate this, the human brain creates new neurons throughout your whole life, this is called neurogenesis. These newly created neurons usually die away when they're not needed. But while the brain is stimulated or trained, these neurons get a chance to form new connections to other neurons instead of dying away, and thus improve the human brain. [Klemm, 2008][#Klemm:2008]
