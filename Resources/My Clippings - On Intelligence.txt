According to functionalism, being intelligent or having a mind is purely a property of organization and has nothing inherently to do with what you’re organized out of. A mind exists in any system whose constituent parts have the right causal relationship with each other, but those parts can just as validly be neurons, silicon chips, or something else.

Neurons are quite slow compared to the transistors in a computer. A neuron collects inputs from its synapses, and combines these inputs together to decide when to output a spike to other neurons. A typical neuron can do this and reset itself in about five milliseconds (5 ms), or around two hundred times per second. This may seem fast, but a modern silicon-based computer can do one billion operations in a second.

Capacity is the first issue. Let’s say the cortex has 32 trillion synapses. If we represented each synapse using only two bits (giving us four possible values per synapse) and each byte has eight bits (so one byte could represent four synapses), then we would need roughly 8 trillion bytes of memory. A hard drive on a personal computer today has 100 billion bytes, so we would need about eighty of today’s hard drives to have the same amount of memory as a human cortex.

The second problem we have to overcome is connectivity. Real brains have large amounts of subcortical white matter. As we noted earlier, the white matter is made up of the millions of axons streaming this way and that just beneath the thin cortical sheet, connecting the different regions of the cortical hierarchy with each other. An individual cell in the cortex may connect to five or ten thousand other cells. This kind of massively parallel wiring is difficult or impossible to implement using traditional silicon manufacturing techniques.
