Computers can “learn” new things instantly by loading a program into memory. But the brain does no such thing. It makes no distinction at all between hardware and software. The way its neurons are wired together is its software. The brain learns by reinforcing existing connections between neurons, making new connections, and unmaking old ones.

So while one can’t discount the possibility of one brain learning to “understand” another’s raw, unfiltered output, it would probably take much time and effort. It is more feasible, conceptually speaking, to identify one brain’s high-level interpretations of experience, where the noise and jitter have been filtered out, and evoke equivalent activity in another brain.

By inserting channelrhodopsin and GFP genes into a neuron, one can make it fire at will and visually confirm that it has fired, simply by shining light of various wavelengths at it through a fiber-optic cable. The fiber-optic cable lets one activate cells and confirm their firing at the same time. In other words, it makes it possible to “write” to an area of the brain and “read” from it at the same time, using the same cable. That is, to invoke two-way information flow.15

They had a way of ensuring that only a specific volume of brain tissue got the genes, by injecting tiny amounts of the virus into it. 5. They had promoters that let them select a cell type. If they wanted channelrhodopsin to work only in, say, parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons, they could use the promoter for that cell type. 6.
